### ðŸŽ‰ First Production Release

This is the first production-ready release of Layup, a command-line tool that generates Apple MDM Home Screen Layout configuration profiles from plain text Bundle ID lists.

### Added

#### Core Functionality
- **Argument Parsing & Help System** - Complete command-line interface with `--help` flag
- **Input File Processing** - Robust file reading with validation and error handling

- **File Output** - Safe file writing with overwrite protection and Finder integration
- **User Feedback** - Clear validation messages and statistics reporting

#### Features
- Support for comments (lines starting with `#`)
- Empty line handling for better file organization
- Case-sensitive Bundle ID preservation
- XML special character escaping (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`)
- Interactive file overwrite confirmation
- Automatic `.mobileconfig` extension handling
- Finder integration (opens file location after generation)
- XML validation with `xmllint`
- Detailed validation statistics (valid/invalid/comments/empty lines)

#### Testing
- **197 total tests** with **98.5% pass rate** (194 passing)
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (769 lines of tests)
- Integration test suite (29 tests)
- Test infrastructure validation (15 tests)
- Cross-platform testing documentation
- MDM deployment testing guide

#### Documentation
- Complete README.md with usage examples
- CONTRIBUTING.md with development workflow
- TESTING_GUIDE.md with comprehensive testing procedures
- BUNDLE_ID_REFERENCE.md with validation rules and common Bundle IDs
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with technical specifications
- Sample input files in `examples/` directory
- Expected output files in `examples/expected_outputs/` directory

#### Infrastructure
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Bats testing framework integration
- Branch protection documentation
- Test helper functions (mocks and assertions)
- Automated test execution on push/PR

### Technical Details

#### Phase 2 Completion - Core Functionality
All five Phase 2 components implemented and tested:
1. **Argument Parsing** - Help system and input validation
2. **Input File Reading** - File validation, line-by-line processing, content filtering
3. **Bundle ID Validation** - Regex validation, advanced rules, error reporting
4. **XML Generation** - Dynamic values, XML escaping, complete structure
5. **File Output** - Filename generation, overwrite handling, validation

#### Phase 3 Completion - Testing & Validation
- Integration testing with end-to-end workflows
- Manual MDM deployment testing documentation
- Cross-platform testing (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Test execution report with detailed results

#### Test Statistics
- **Unit Tests:** 769 lines across 5 test files
- **Integration Tests:** 29 comprehensive tests
- **Infrastructure Tests:** 15 framework validation tests
- **Total:** 197 tests with 98.5% success rate
- **Known Issues:** 3 minor test failures (non-blocking)

### Validation Rules

Bundle IDs must:
- Have at least 2 segments separated by dots (e.g., `com.apple`)
- Use only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphens (-), and underscores (_)
- Not start or end with a dot
- Not have consecutive dots
- Be case-sensitive (preserve exact case)

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success or user cancelled |
| 1 | Input file not found |
| 2 | Input file empty |
| 3 | No valid Bundle IDs found |
| 4 | Cannot write output file |
| 5 | XML validation failed |

### Example Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
./layup.sh input.txt output.mobileconfig

# Using sample files
./layup.sh examples/sample_apps.txt my_layout.mobileconfig

# View help
./layup.sh --help
```

### System Requirements

- **Operating System:** macOS 10.15+ (Catalina or later)
- **Shell:** Bash 3.2+ or Zsh
- **Optional:** `xmllint` for XML validation
- **Optional:** `uuidgen` for UUID generation (fallback provided)

### Known Limitations

- Single page layout only (multi-page support planned for Phase 2)
- No dock configuration (planned for Phase 2)
- No folder support (planned for Phase 2)
- Requires manual MDM deployment
