- **No Folders:** Does not support organizing apps into folders
- **macOS Dependency:** Finder integration only works on macOS

### Support and Maintenance

- This is a community-maintained project
- No warranty or guaranteed support is provided
- Review the LICENSE file for complete terms
- Consider forking for organization-specific modifications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Input file not found"**
```
ERROR: Input file 'apps.txt' not found
```
**Solution:** Check that the file exists and the path is correct. Use absolute paths if needed.

---

**Issue: "No valid Bundle IDs found"**
```
ERROR: No valid Bundle IDs found in input file
```
**Solution:** Ensure your Bundle IDs follow the correct format (minimum 2 segments, e.g., `com.apple.app`). Check for typos and invalid characters.

---

**Issue: "Directory is not writable"**
```
ERROR: Directory is not writable: /path/to/output
```
**Solution:** Check directory permissions with `ls -la`. Ensure you have write access or choose a different output directory.

---

**Issue: "XML validation failed"**
```
ERROR: XML validation failed for: output.mobileconfig
```
**Solution:** This is an internal error. Please report it as a bug with your input file and system details.

---

**Issue: File overwrite prompt not appearing**
```
File 'output.mobileconfig' already exists. Overwrite? (y/n):
```
**Solution:** This is expected behavior. Enter `y` to overwrite or `n` to cancel. The script will re-prompt if you enter an invalid response.

---

**Issue: Invalid Bundle ID format**
```
✗ Line 5: com..app (invalid format: consecutive dots)
```
**Solution:** Fix the Bundle ID format. Remove consecutive dots, ensure minimum 2 segments, and use only valid characters (letters, numbers, underscore, hyphen).

### Validation Errors

The script provides detailed validation feedback:

```
✓ Line 1: com.apple.safari (valid)
✗ Line 2: invalid (invalid format: not enough segments)
✓ Line 3: com.google.chrome.ios (valid)
✗ Line 4: com.app name (invalid format: contains whitespace)

Validation Summary:
  Valid Bundle IDs: 2
  Invalid Bundle IDs: 2
  Comments: 0
  Empty lines: 0
```

**Action:** Fix the invalid Bundle IDs based on the specific error reason provided.

### Debug Mode

For troubleshooting, you can enable verbose output:

```bash
# Run with bash debug mode
bash -x ./layup.sh apps.txt
```

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is a Bundle ID?**  
A: A Bundle ID is a unique identifier for an iOS/iPadOS app, typically in reverse-domain format (e.g., `com.apple.safari`). It's used by Apple's operating systems to identify and manage applications.

**Q: Where can I find Bundle IDs for apps?**  
A: Bundle IDs can be found in:
- App Store Connect (for your own apps)
- MDM solution's app catalog
- Third-party app databases
- Using tools like `iMazing` or `Apple Configurator`

**Q: Can I use this for iPad and iPhone?**  
A: Yes! The generated configuration profiles work for both iOS (iPhone) and iPadOS (iPad) devices managed by an MDM solution.

**Q: Does this work with all MDM solutions?**  
A: Yes, the generated `.mobileconfig` files follow Apple's standard MDM protocol and should work with any compliant MDM solution (Jamf Pro, Workspace ONE, Intune, etc.).

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why do I need an MDM solution?**  
A: Home Screen Layout configuration profiles can only be deployed through Mobile Device Management (MDM). They cannot be installed directly by users.

**Q: Can I edit the generated XML file?**  
A: Yes, but be careful! The XML structure must remain valid. It's better to modify your input file and regenerate.

**Q: What happens if I have more than one page worth of apps?**  
A: Currently, all apps are placed on a single page. Future versions may support multiple pages. For now, consider splitting into multiple profiles.

**Q: Can I specify app positions or create folders?**  
A: Not in the current version. All apps are placed sequentially on one page. These features may be added in future releases.

**Q: Is the script compatible with older macOS versions?**  
A: The script requires macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later. It uses Bash 3.2+ features and relies on `xmllint` for validation.

### Usage Questions

**Q: Can I run this on Linux or Windows?**  
A: The script is designed for macOS but may work on Linux with `xmllint` installed. Windows users can use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or Git Bash. Finder integration will not work outside macOS.

**Q: How do I update an existing configuration?**  
A: Modify your input file and regenerate the profile. Deploy the new profile through your MDM, which will update devices.

**Q: Can I version control my input files?**  
A: Absolutely! Input files are plain text and work great with Git or other version control systems.

**Q: What if I need to remove apps from the layout?**  
A: Remove the Bundle IDs from your input file and regenerate the profile. Deploy the updated profile through your MDM.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: Why does validation fail for a Bundle ID that looks correct?**  
A: Common issues include:
- Hidden whitespace (copy-paste artifacts)
- Only one segment (needs minimum 2, e.g., `com.app`)
- Special characters not allowed (only letters, numbers, underscore, hyphen, and dots)
- Consecutive dots or dots at start/end

**Q: The script says "Success" but I don't see the file?**  
A: Check the output path shown in the success message. The file may be in a different directory than expected. Use absolute paths to avoid confusion.

**Q: Can I automate this script in a CI/CD pipeline?**  
A: Yes! The script is designed for automation. Use the non-interactive mode by ensuring output files don't exist, or handle the overwrite prompt programmatically.
